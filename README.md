## play

`python/playground.py` is a dashbord where you can play with different initial conditions.

With `python/chaos.py` you can get a nice effect of chaos. Make a small change to any initial value and the outcome will differ dramatically.

## Modules

`python/three_bodies.py` contain the model for initiating a particle array and updating it. Don't touch.

`python/plot.py` contain a function you import to write a mpeg-plot. Can take a really long time for long simulations.

You will need a ffmpeg writer. For Linux do `apt-get install ffmpeg`


`matlab/` is legacy.
