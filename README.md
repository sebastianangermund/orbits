## play

`python/playground.py` is a dashbord where you can play with different initial conditions. This is everything you need to touch.

`python/three_bodies.py` contain the model for initiating a particle array and updating it. Don't touch.

`python/plot.py` contain a function you import to write a mpeg-plot. Can take a really long time for long simulations.

You will need a ffmpeg writer. For Linux do `apt-get install ffmpeg`

`matlab/` is legacy.
